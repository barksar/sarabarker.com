    <h2>2025 Highlights</h2>
    <p>To be perfrectly frank, 2025 has been a year full of anger. It's not secret that we are living in a time during which the current presidential administration is continuouly testing the resiliance of our nation's democracy. I will say this about that (taken from "Giving Up is Unforgivable" by Joyce Vance: 1. Please vote. 2. Please educate yourself and your loved ones about the principles and governance underpinning our democracy. 3. Protest - it is our right as Americans, get out and do it.  is being tested.  been full of adventures and milestones. The kids wrapped up another great year at school, and we celebrated with a long weekend trip to the beach. We finally mastered paddleboarding (well—mostly!), and the sunsets were unforgettable.</p>

 <p>TIn addition to fighting for democracy, Rich continues to enjoy teaching at Yorktown High School, Sara continues to work for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and run Avant Bard Theatre in Arlington along with working on grassroots support for the arts as Co-President of Embracing Arlington Arts. Fiona continues to work hard at ballet, which she loves, and Walter, in addition to soccer, has taken up drawing and tennis! The whole family continues to love taking a break to go to Bethany Beach and we're brushing up on our French in preparation for a November 2026 trip to Paris to celebrate Sara's 50th birthday!</p>
