# sarabarker.com – Personal Website

This repository contains the source files (HTML, CSS, images) for my personal website, built with GitHub Pages. The site includes:

- A public homepage with my **acting resume**  
- A public page about my role as **Producing Artistic Director** at *Avant Bard Theatre*  
- A public page about my **professional career** in technical communication and managing editing of cybersecurity publications at CISA  
- A **hidden page** with personal updates for friends and family

## 🧠 About

This project serves as the content and code for my personal site at **sarabarker.com**. The site is hosted using **GitHub Pages**, and updates are published automatically whenever I push changes to this repository.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `index.html` — Acting resume homepage  
- `acting.html` — Acting reviews and photos
- `artistic-director.html` — Artistic director experience  
- `technical-communicator.html` — Career portfolio and experience  
- `personal-updates.html` — Hidden page for updates shared via QR code  
- `style.css` — Main styling file  
- `assets/` — Images and other media referenced in the site

## 🚀 How It Works

This is a static HTML/CSS site. Each HTML file represents a page of the website. Navigation between pages is handled by links in the site header.

The site is published via **GitHub Pages** — it’s set up in the repository settings to use this branch as the publish source.

## 🔗 Custom Domain
    
This repository is configured to use the custom domain **sarabarker.com**. A `CNAME` file in the repo tells GitHub Pages to serve the site from that domain.

DNS records at the domain registrar (Network Solutions) are set so that:
- `sarabarker.com` points to GitHub Pages’ IP addresses  
- `www.sarabarker.com` redirects to the same site

## 🛠 How Updates Happen

To update this site, edit the HTML and CSS files in this repository and commit your changes. GitHub Pages will publish the updated site automatically when changes are pushed to the main branch.

Only authorized contributors should edit this content. Reach out to me directly if you need access or have content updates.
